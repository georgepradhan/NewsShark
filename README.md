# NewsShark #
## NewsShark delivers news articles on topics important to you. You can create "channels" to listen for relevant stories, and you rate the ones that you like or dislike. Over time, your channel learns about your preferences and delivers customized recommendations based on article characteristics such as author, publication, word-count, keywords, readability metrics, and more. Utilizing our own in-house machine learning system and content-ranking algorithm, NewsShark does for the news what Pandora does for music: we filter out the noise. ##

## We built this web application in 7 days. 2 weeks prior, we had never worked with Ruby on Rails. In addition to our custom-built machine learning algorithm and recommendation engine, the project ended with over 98% test coverage and an average of 12 hits per line for over 650 relevant lines of code ##
